## UI Components

Components are "chunks" of your website that are structurally the same, but with different information contained in them. The project features in your Pretty Things Gallery are a perfect example: they have identical html/css configuration but a different title, image, and hyperlinks.  Bootstrap is ideal for building UI component-based landing pages
