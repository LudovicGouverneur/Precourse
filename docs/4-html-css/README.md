## HTML & CSS

The building blocks for web-development are HTML and CSS.  You will be able to build your first projects without any JavaScript. 

To cover the basics of HTML/CSS we recommend following [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-front-end-development-projects) as far as the __Responsive Design with Bootstrap__.  In this series of exercises and projects you will learn some HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as well as how to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/hello/) to host your projects.

## Specifications

1. Follow a tutorial of your choice, FreeCodeCamp is a good place to start.
2. Build a minimum of 6 basic websites with only HTML & CSS. Make them all a little different, try to explore the possibilities and your limits. Feel free to develop them wherever you are comfortable - CodePen, Glitch, JSFiddle, ...  
3. When you have finished each one of these sites, copy paste the code to GitHub.  Set each repository's Gh-Pages to build from master.
4. Build a Gallery Page using Bootstrap. This site will use the grid system to feature each page you built and provide links to the repos & live demos.
5. Link to this Pretty Things Gallery in your Portfolio.

## Resources



FreeCodeCamp has a good series of exercises, but it has very few explanations of how things work.  To support you through FreeCodeCamp, we recommend these resources:
* [Marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io) has a very clean and friendly introduction to using HTML and CSS.  
* [W3 Schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [W3 Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). These are less friendly than Marksheet, but have much more information.  You will be using W3 Schools to look up HTML and CSS details for the rest of your developer lifes.  
* FreeCodeCamp has a [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org), a [chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/CodeReview), and a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) where you can find support from people working on the same problems as you.
* [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com).  Very well paced introduction to the web environment and using html/css from the bottom up.

Self-Assessments:
* [HTML Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp)
* [CSS Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp)

CodePen Alternatives:
[Glitch](https://glitch.com) - We recommend using this tool to develop your portfolio.  It will help you now, and will prepare you for working in a real Text Editor.

And as always, don't forget to ask each other for help on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/elewa-academy/shared_invite/enQtMjk4OTA3OTM1NjIwLTA2ZmQ0NDVhNjQxZWM2NjNhNmMyNmVhZGNhZmJmZTY1OWQ4Nzc0ZTkzZGE3NjdiYTYwYThlNzI3YTg2NGM5MGM)!
