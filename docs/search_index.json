Precourse","keywords":"","body":"Elewa Precourse\nIt's very important that you are comfortable with JS, HTML, CSS and GitHub before moving on in this curriculum. Starting unprepared will not only slow down your learning, but will impact your study partners as well.  The pressure is on!\nBut it's not that bad to get ready, slow and steady wins the race!  Start today and code every day, even just a bit. Here's a great article about why and how to write code every day.  It's written by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.  This website is also a great tool for keeping yourself on track.  \nWhile you're planning your study schedule, try to keep this simple rule in mind: \n\n80% JavaScript. 20% everything else.  \n\nJavaScript is the most important and the most challenging piece of this pre-course.  The more you learn now, the more you will learn later.\nIt is also important that you have a portfolio to work with.  You'll use this portfolio to showcase the work you do in this curriculum, and to present yourself to potential collaborators and employers.  \n\nBe sure to sign on to Slack so you can keep in touch!\n\n\n\n"},"0-take-good-notes/":{"url":"0-take-good-notes/","title":"0. Take Good Notes","keywords":"","body":"Study Journal\nOf all the skills you will need as a developer effective learning is the most important.  There is no library, no framework, no buzzword you can master that will serve you better than strong study and learning habits.  \nFortunately studying and learning are skills you can improve.  Keeping an organized study journal is the first step.  So take some extra time before, during, and after you write some code to write down some notes on what you just learned.\nAs you work through this curriculum we will often recommend ways to take notes on particular topics (ie. descriptive diagrams, questions to explore, organizing & deploying your notes), but for now take your notes however you usually do.

If you don't make an effort to manage your learning process you'll be surprised at how quickly it can slip away from you.\nPay special attention to:\n\nVocabulary: In programming words have very specific definitions, it's important that you use them precisely.  This can be extra tricky since many of the key programming vocab words are also non-programming words.  It's easy to slip back and forth between a word's every-day meaning and it's programming definition.\nYour Challenges: Take especially good notes on what you find difficult even if that just means you write a quick list of things you struggled with today.  Not only will this help you structure your studying by concentrating on your weak points, but it will also help you learn to pin-point what you don't understand.  This kind of self-awareness is crucial for software developers.\nWhat you enjoy: As you continue to study programming you will get discouraged.  Having a record of all the things you enjoy about coding will help with more than just motivation.  It will also help you learn more effectively, it's easier to focus on and learn something you enjoy.  You can think of this list like a back-up study plan.  Whenever you're about to walk out, pull up this list and build something fun!\nStages of development:  While you're building your projects, don't just focus on the finished product.  Focus on the journey.  This might sound corny, but the truth is that one of the biggest differences between beginner programmers and expert programmers is the way approach & build up projects in careful steps.  You'll get a chance to learn about this in more detail later on, but it's never too late to get started! \n\nTOP\n\nResources\nEffective Learning\nTracking Your Progress:\n\nWrite Code Every Day\nKeep a Study Journal\nWeekly Review Day\n\nThings to Study:\n\njsdude\n\nMarkdown (if you like pretty notes):\n\nTutorial\nReference\n\nA paper notebook:  \n\nNothing beats a pencil and paper for sketching diagrams or taking down a quick note.\n\nFun challenge: \n\nTake notes with Terminal &  Nano\nOne Article\nAnother Article\nThe Docs\n\n\n\n\n"},"1-being-a-developer/":{"url":"1-being-a-developer/","title":"1. Being a Developer","keywords":"","body":"Coding is Communication\n\n“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” - John Woods\n\nSoftware developers, especially in small to medium sized companies, are responsible for more than just typing code.  You will sit in a key position between customers, marketers, designers, managers, deployment machines, and your fellow developers.  At the end of the day it is your responsibility to ensure that there is a working application which fits the end user's needs, deploys smoothly on the necessary platforms, and is scalable and maintainable. \nSource code is your final product.  After hours of planning, emailing, testing, coding, and getting stuck on bugs, all that's left is the source code.  And there's no guarantee that you'll be the one to maintain your code.  This means it's crucial for you to embed everything you know about the project directly into your code. Completed source code is the most powerful tool you have for sharing your knowledge of the application. \nYour finished code needs to be understandable to 3 very different, and equally important audiences:\n\nEnd Users must understand why they're using your software and how to use it\nDevelopers must understand how to test, maintain, expand, and re-use your code\nDeployment Environments must receive carefully tuned, compiled code or risk crashing\n\nWe like to think a lot about number 2, and hopefully you will too.\nBefore you dive into the hard stuff, it's worth taking a moment to get your head in the right place.  Some of the resources below will help you set expectations for how much you'll need to work and what kind of progress you can expect to make in your time with Elewa.

Students in the past have really enjoyed Visual Studio Code.  Atom and Sublime are also good options.  We recommend Visual Studio Code so that all of you are on the same editor, this will make it easier for you to help each other. \nChrome.  For web development there is no better browser than Chrome.  So far in your life, you have probably used your browser to troll the web and visit websites.  In our course you will learn to use your browser to edit, test, inspect, and debug code.  Any browser is fine for trolling, only Chrome will have all the tools you need to develop. \n\nTerminal. All computers already come with a terminal, the application that lets you work directly with your computer. Usually when you want to open or edit a file you'll do it by clicking on icons and working in applications. With terminal, you can do all of these things by typing commands directly into the computer.  This will be necessary for running any application with a backend, for smooth development of frontend apps, and for more efficient file navigation.\nIf you have a mac or Linux machine there is nothing to install.  If you have a window's machine you should install Cygwin.  Most Node developer tools don't play nicely with Window's machines, Cygwin will act like a translator so you can use your terminal as though it were a Linux machine.\n\nCygwin, if you're on a windows machine.  \nOr better yet, Linux.  If you have a Windows machine, you can fix all of your problems at once by installing Linux.   \n\n\n\n\nGit.  Like terminal, if you have a mac or Linux machine you're already set.  If you are on a Windows machine you will need to install it separately.\nGit  \n\n\n\n\nNode.js.  In the past, browsers were the only place you could run JavaScript code.  Node.js allows you to run JS outside of the browser. We will talk more about just what Node is after the first week of class. You will not need this for the precourse, but it best to come prepared.    \n\nPackage managers.  NPM and Yarn are the most popular Node.js package managers.  NPM comes built-in with Node so there is no need to install this one separately.  Yarn has several advantages over NPM that don't matter to you yet.  \n\nYarn\n\n\n\nIf you're having trouble getting this set up don't hesitate to ask each other for help on Slack, or to send us an email.\n\n\n\n"},"5-next-steps/git.html":{"url":"5-next-steps/git.html","title":"Git","keywords":"","body":"What is GIT ?\n\nGit is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). \nGit allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.\nGit allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.\n\nGit has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will be enough for now.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nlearngitbranching.js.org\nTHE Git video\nRoger Dudler's handbook to using git - Cheat sheet with the most common commands.\nA good introduction video, if you're into videos. \nTraversy Media crash course, another video intro.\nGit CLI game.

GIT and Github allows you to protect your code against silly mistakes, organize, and document your code so others know how to use it and what to use it for.\nTOP\n\nWhat is GitHub\ntl;dr - it can be anything you need it to be.  \nWe'll be discussing the following uses in this course:\n\nRemote hosting for Git repositories.  With pushing and pulling, you can use GitHub to back up your work.  If you stop there, you're a fool. GitHub can do so much more for you.\nPersonal portfolio. GitHub has built-in tools for hosting static pages. With a little ingenuity this can be used to build a portfolio that's fully integrated with your GitHub account.\n\nThese are for you to explore on your own:\n\nSocial network and linkedin for developers.\nProject hosting and project management.\nAn infinite library of useful code to study or use. \nInteractive documentation.\nIntegrator with many apps - we used sketchboard.io's integration for this diagram.\n\n\nWe've created our curriculum entirely on GitHub relying mostly on these features: github pages, organizations, and repos.\nTOP\n\nHow it all fits\n\nGit is like a really epic save button for your files and directories - officially Git is called a version control system.\nTo compare, a save in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like essay.doc unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):\nessay-draft1.doc, essay-draft2.doc, essay-final.doc\nA save in Git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub for shari ng and collaborating with other developers.\nWhile Git works on your local machine, GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use Git as an essential skill for a modern web developer to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.\nIn the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.\nAnd finally, you will set up a project with Git and this will serve as a template for setting up your future projects.\nTOP\n\nGit Clients\nGit can be tricky to use directly from terminal when you are first learning.  Fortunately the way git works in the background means that it is very easy to visualize what's happening with a desktop application.  These applications are called Git Clients.  There are many out there, so we will just mention 3 here:\n\nVisual Studio Code.  Yes indeed, VSC has built-in tools to help you with git.  You can clone, branch, commit and more.  This may be the best option for starting out, the less you have to switch between applications the easier it will be to learn.\nGitHub Desktop.  Created by GitHub, this client is simple and easy to use.  It's not as powerful as others but it's more than enough to complete the precourse.\nGitKraken.  This is the full-powered developer's git tool.  Keep it in mind for later.\n\nTOP\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy the end of this step in the Precourse you should be able to:\n\nDescribe the differences between Git, Github and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping\nDescribe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers\nPush, pull, branch, add, commit.  These commands will be necessary to complete the next round of projects.\n\nTOP\n\nSSH Keys\nRead this article to learn why SSH keys are so useful and how to use them.  This will make your life much easier.\nTOP\n\nResources:\n\nLaunch School's Git and Github. Resource for learning about git and github.\nGit and Github in plain English.
