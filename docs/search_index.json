Elewa Students!\nIt's very important that you build a strong foundation in JavaScript before moving on to Fundamentals. Starting unprepared will not only slow down your learning, but will impact your study partners as well.  The pressure is on!\nBut it's not that bad to get ready, slow and steady wins the race!  Start today and code every day, even just a bit. Here's a great article about why and how to write code every day.  It's written by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.  This website is also a great tool for keeping yourself on track.  \nWhile you're planning your study schedule, try to keep this simple rule in mind: \n\n80% JavaScript. 20% everything else.\n\nIt is important that you have a portfolio to work with, but don't spend too much time on it yet.  The basic portfolio you'll complete in FreeCodeCamp is enough - it's more important that you have solid JS fundamentals.  And don't worry about having a stylish portfolio just yet, one of our class projects will be rebuilding it with React components.\nTake some time to meet the community on the Elewa Slack.

Learn it! \nHere you will learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language and start getting used solving small problems with code.  The basic syntax in JavaScript isn't too complicated, it shouldn't take you very long to start writing code that doesn't break your computer.  What's much much harder to learn is thinking algorithmically.  No matter how smart you are, or how good you are at other difficult tasks, solving interesting problems with JavaScript may be very hard for you.  \nThis is totally normal.  Being good at programming, or learning it quickly, are not indicators of how intelligent you are.  They are indicators of how close your thinking style is to that of a computer programmer.  \nDon't be discouraged!  If you start studying now and continue to work hard through your 10 weeks with us you will come out understanding the principles of software development, and how they apply to real-world problem solving.  This is a far more important skill than just learning to program.  It will prepare you to join a development team immediately, and give you the foundations necessary to keep improving after you leave.\nSo study hard! Dig in now, and keep at it every day.  The more you prepare, the more everyone will benefit.\n\nResources\nBelow are a few options for learning JavaScript.  Take a look at each one and see what works best for you.  If you find another one you like better, send it our way and we'll put it up!\nPractical Introductions:\n\nHeadfirst JavaScript: PDF, GitHub\nInteractive GitBook\n\nJS Resources:\n\nFreeCodeCamp's video series.

Students in the past have really enjoyed Visual Studio Code.  Atom and Sublime are also good options.  We recommend Visual Studio Code so that all of you are on the same editor, this will make it easier for you to help each other. \nChrome.  For web development there is no better browser than Chrome.  So far in your life, you have probably used your browser to troll the web and visit websites.  In our course you will learn to use your browser to edit, test, inspect, and debug code.  Any browser is fine for trolling, only Chrome will have all the tools you need to develop. \n\nTerminal. All computers already come with a terminal, the application that lets you work directly with your computer. Usually when you want to open or edit a file you'll do it by clicking on icons and working in applications. With terminal, you can do all of these things by typing commands directly into the computer.  This will be necessary for running any application with a backend, for smooth development of frontend apps, and for more efficient file navigation.\nIf you have a mac or Linux machine there is nothing to install.  If you have a window's machine you should install Cygwin.  Most Node developer tools don't play nicely with Window's machines, Cygwin will act like a translator so you can use your terminal as though it were a Linux machine.\n\nCygwin, if you're on a windows machine.  \nOr better yet, Linux.  If you have a Windows machine, you can fix all of your problems at once by installing Linux.   \n\n\n\n\nGit.  Like terminal, if you have a mac or Linux machine you're already set.  If you are on a Windows machine you will need to install it separately.\nGit  \n\n\n\n\nNode.js.  In the past, browsers were the only place you could run JavaScript code.  Node.js allows you to run JS outside of the browser. We will talk more about just what Node is after the first week of class. You will not need this for the precourse, but it best to come prepared.    \n\nPackage managers.  NPM and Yarn are the most popular Node.js package managers.  NPM comes built-in with Node so there is no need to install this one separately.  Yarn has several advantages over NPM that don't matter to you yet.  \n\nYarn\n\n\n\nIf you're having trouble getting this set up don't hesitate to ask each other for help on Slack, or to send us an email.\n\n\n\n"},"5-working-locally/1-dev-environment.html":{"url":"5-working-locally/1-dev-environment.html","title":"Dev Environment","keywords":"","body":"Dev Environment\nCongratulations on finishing the Basic Front End Projects in FreeCodeCamp!

GIT and Github allows you to protect your code against silly mistakes, organize, and document your code so others know how to use it and what to use it for.\nTOP\nWhat is GIT\n\nGit is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). \nGit allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.\nGit allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.\n\nGit has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will carry farther than you can see without awakening your third eye.\nTOP\n\nWhat is GitHub\ntl;dr - it can be anything you need it to be.  \nWe'll be discussing the following uses in this course:\n\nRemote hosting for Git repositories.  With pushing and pulling, you can use GitHub to back up your work.  If you stop there, you're a fool. GitHub can do so much more for you.\nPersonal portfolio. GitHub has built-in tools for hosting static pages. With a little ingenuity this can be used to build a portfolio that's fully integrated with your GitHub account.\n\nThese are for you to explore on your own:\n\nSocial network and linkedin for developers.\nProject hosting and project management.\nAn infinite library of useful code to study or use. \nInteractive documentation.\nIntegrator with many apps - we used sketchboard.io's integration for this diagram.\n\n\nWe've created our curriculum entirely on GitHub relying mostly on these features: github pages, organizations, and repos.\nTOP\n\nHow it all fits\n\nGit is like a really epic save button for your files and directories - officially Git is called a version control system.\nTo compare, a save in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like essay.doc unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):\nessay-draft1.doc, essay-draft2.doc, essay-final.doc\nA save in Git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub for shari ng and collaborating with other developers.\nWhile Git works on your local machine, GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use Git as an essential skill for a modern web developer to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.\nIn the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.\nAnd finally, you will set up a project with Git and this will serve as a template for setting up your future projects.\nTOP\n\nGit Clients\nGit can be tricky to use directly from terminal when you are first learning.  Fortunately the way git works in the background means that it is very easy to visualize what's happening with a desktop application.  These applications are called Git Clients.  There are many out there, so we will just mention 3 here:\n\nVisual Studio Code.  Yes indeed, VSC has built-in tools to help you with git.  You can clone, branch, commit and more.  This may be the best option for starting out, the less you have to switch between applications the easier it will be to learn.\nGitHub Desktop.  Created by GitHub, this client is simple and easy to use.  It's not as powerful as others but it's more than enough to complete the precourse.\nGitKraken.  This is the full-powered developer's git tool.  Keep it in mind for later.\n\nTOP\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy the end of this step in the precourse you should be able to:\n\nDescribe the differences between Git, Github and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping\nDescribe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers\nPush, pull, branch, add, commit.  These commands will be necessary to build your portfolio.\n\nTOP\n\nSSH Keys\nRead this article to learn why SSH keys are so useful and how to use them.  This will make your life much easier.\nTOP\n\nResources:\n\nGit and Github in plain English.  Out standing overview.\nRoger Dudler's handbook to using git.\nA good introduction video, if you're into videos. \nTraversy Media crash course, another video intro.\nThe best place to practice git, great visualizations.\nGit CLI game.  A git tutorial run from your terminal.\nIf you REALLY want to know how git works, watch this video.\n\n\n\n\n"}}}
