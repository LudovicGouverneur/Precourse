Elewa Students!\nIt's very important that you build a strong foundation in JavaScript before moving on to Fundamentals. Starting unprepared will not only slow down your learning, but will impact your study partners as well.  The pressure is on!\nBut it's not that bad to get ready, slow and steady wins the race!  Start today and code every day, even just a bit. Here's a great article about why and how to write code every day.  It's written by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.\nThe DOM is a programming API for documents. It is based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:\n      \n       \n       \n      Shady Grove\n      Aeolian \n       \n      \n      Over the river, Charlie        \n      Dorian \n       \n      \n      \n\nA graphical representation of the DOM of the example table is:\n\nJS Runtime\nA page does not just get rendered, but is read from top to bottom; as it reads the browser tries to load execute and read all the external js, css, images and video.\nA JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.\nTo execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:\n\nonclick=JavaScript\n\nExamples of HTML events:\n\nWhen a user clicks the mouse\nWhen a web page has loaded\nWhen an image has been loaded\nWhen the mouse moves over an element\nWhen an input field is changed\nWhen an HTML form is submitted\nWhen a user strokes a key\n\nIn this example, the content of the  element is changed when a user clicks on it:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on this text!\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP\nWe'll let Harvard explain it... \nhttp://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/http/http-720p.mp4\nExternal Resources\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_events.asp\nHow does the internet work:\npart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ\npart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAPjr7vgxE\n\n\nEverything - http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm#The_main_flow\n\nDeveloper Tools\nWhat are developer tools?\nAll of the most popular modern web browsers include a suite of tools designed to help with the development of websites; they are also sometimes referred to as the web inspector. These tools allow you to inspect the html, css, javascript and much more on websites you visit and build.\nWhy do you need to know how to use them?\nKnowing how to use your browsers developer tools is an indispensable skill for a web developer. They allow you to easily and quickly track down the cause of issues and bugs like problems with layout or other css hiccups. What might have taken an hour or even a few hours to track down and fix without the use of these tools often takes a matter of minutes or even seconds with the help of developer tools.\nAlthough they offer you so many useful capabilities, learning how to use the developer tools isn't that difficult. It can feel clunky the first few times you use them. But with a little practice, you will soon find yourself comfortably using them to experiment and fix bugs with ease on your web pages.\nChromeDev\nComplete the first two chapters of this short course from Codeschool, it covers all the main capabilities developer tools provides.\nMake sure you can answer yes to each of the following once you have finished the course above:\n\nYou can open the developer tools in your browser.\nYou can select a specific html element in your page with dev tools.\nYou can you use developer tools to experiment with the css on specific elements on a web page.\n\nResource\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/\nOld Slides\n\n\n\n"},"2-web-development/2-js-html-css.html":{"url":"2-web-development/2-js-html-css.html","title":"JS, HTML & CSS","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript, HTML & CSS\nThese three tools are usually grouped together because they are all necessary to build interesting websites, but each one totally unique.\nJavaScript\nThis is the meat in your cake.  JavaScript is a full programming language with super powers.  Along with the standard functionalities of any programming language JavaScript can:\n\nManipulate the DOM in your browser\nSend and receive HTTP requests\nPerform asynchronous operations\nOffload work to 3rd party services\n\nYou'll learn more about all these features later on in this bootcamp.  For now you'll just have to worry about the basics (functions, variables, control flow), and a little bit of DOM manipulation.\nHTML\nHTML is a markup language used to define layout and appearance of your website.  At least until HTML5 came out.  HTML5 adds a lot of functionality to your markup, but is still not as powerful as JavaScript or CSS.\nCSS\nCSS isn't quite a Markup Language, and isn't quite a programming language.  But it can be used to many of the same things as JS or HTML.

What's much much harder to learn is thinking algorithmically.  No matter how smart you are, or how good you are at other difficult tasks, solving interesting problems with JavaScript may be very hard for you.  \nThis is totally normal.  Being good at programming, or learning it quickly, are not indicators of how intelligent you are.

Students in the past have really enjoyed Visual Studio Code.  Atom and Sublime are also good options.  We recommend Visual Studio Code so that all of you are on the same editor, this will make it easier for you to help each other. \nChrome.  For web development there is no better browser than Chrome.  So far in your life, you have probably used your browser to troll the web and visit websites.  In our course you will learn to use your browser to edit, test, inspect, and debug code.  Any browser is fine for trolling, only Chrome will have all the tools you need to develop. \n\nTerminal. All computers already come with a terminal, the application that lets you work directly with your computer. Usually when you want to open or edit a file you'll do it by clicking on icons and working in applications. With terminal, you can do all of these things by typing commands directly into the computer.  This will be necessary for running any application with a backend, for smooth development of frontend apps, and for more efficient file navigation.\nIf you have a mac or Linux machine there is nothing to install.  If you have a window's machine you should install Cygwin.  Most Node developer tools don't play nicely with Window's machines, Cygwin will act like a translator so you can use your terminal as though it were a Linux machine.\n\nCygwin, if you're on a windows machine.  \nOr better yet, Linux.  If you have a Windows machine, you can fix all of your problems at once by installing Linux.   \n\n\n\n\nGit.  Like terminal, if you have a mac or Linux machine you're already set.

GIT and Github allows you to protect your code against silly mistakes, organize, and document your code so others know how to use it and what to use it for.\nTOP\nWhat is GIT\n\nGit is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). \nGit allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.\nGit allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.\n\nGit has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will carry farther than you can see without awakening your third eye.\nTOP\n\nWhat is GitHub\ntl;dr - it can be anything you need it to be.  \nWe'll be discussing the following uses in this course:\n\nRemote hosting for Git repositories.  With pushing and pulling, you can use GitHub to back up your work.  If you stop there, you're a fool. GitHub can do so much more for you.\nPersonal portfolio. GitHub has built-in tools for hosting static pages. With a little ingenuity this can be used to build a portfolio that's fully integrated with your GitHub account.\n\nThese are for you to explore on your own:\n\nSocial network and linkedin for developers.\nProject hosting and project management.\nAn infinite library of useful code to study or use. \nInteractive documentation.\nIntegrator with many apps - we used sketchboard.io's integration for this diagram.\n\n\nWe've created our curriculum entirely on GitHub relying mostly on these features: github pages, organizations, and repos.\nTOP\n\nHow it all fits\n\nGit is like a really epic save button for your files and directories - officially Git is called a version control system.\nTo compare, a save in a text editor would record all of the words of a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file like essay.doc unless you make duplicate copies (which would be difficult to remember to do and keep track of):\nessay-draft1.doc, essay-draft2.doc, essay-final.doc\nA save in Git however, would record differences of files and folders AND keep a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub for shari ng and collaborating with other developers.\nWhile Git works on your local machine, GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider the ability to use Git as an essential skill for a modern web developer to have; having a portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.\nIn the next lesson we will go over the basic workflow of using Git which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.\nAnd finally, you will set up a project with Git and this will serve as a template for setting up your future projects.\nTOP\n\nGit Clients\nGit can be tricky to use directly from terminal when you are first learning.  Fortunately the way git works in the background means that it is very easy to visualize what's happening with a desktop application.  These applications are called Git Clients.  There are many out there, so we will just mention 3 here:\n\nVisual Studio Code.  Yes indeed, VSC has built-in tools to help you with git.  You can clone, branch, commit and more.  This may be the best option for starting out, the less you have to switch between applications the easier it will be to learn.\nGitHub Desktop.  Created by GitHub, this client is simple and easy to use.  It's not as powerful as others but it's more than enough to complete the precourse.\nGitKraken.  This is the full-powered developer's git tool.  Keep it in mind for later.\n\nTOP\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy the end of this step in the precourse you should be able to:\n\nDescribe the differences between Git, Github and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping\nDescribe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers\nPush, pull, branch, add, commit.  These commands will be necessary to build your portfolio.\n\nTOP\n\nSSH Keys\nRead this article to learn why SSH keys are so useful and how to use them.  This will make your life much easier.\nTOP\n\nResources:\n\nGit and Github in plain English.  Out standing overview.\nRoger Dudler's handbook to using git.\nA good introduction video, if you're into videos. \nTraversy Media crash course, another video intro.\nThe best place to practice git, great visualizations.\nGit CLI game.
