## UI Components

Components are "chunks" of your website that are structurally the same, but with different information connected to them. Your project boxes are a perfect example: they have identical html/css configuration but a different title, image, and hyperlinks.

We will take this concept to the next level by writing a jQuery method that takes a repo name & image url as arguments and appends a new project component to the end of a "projects" div.
