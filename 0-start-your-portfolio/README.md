# Start Your Portfolio

The portfolio is the modern diploma.  During your time with us you will be continually building and perfecting your portfolio. You will be turning your GitHub account into a fully navigable portfolio site where employers and collaborators can come to see what you're made of.  

Your portfolio doesn't need to be anything fancy, it can be as simple as this [demo Elewa-Student portfolio](https://elewa-student.github.io).  What's important is that you have somewhere you can easily organize and access all of your work.  

Your portfolios will also be how you get to know each ogher. Keep an eye on the [Elewa Wiki](https://github.com/elewa-academy/General-Resources/wiki) to see what your peers are up to!
