## Front End Basics

The building blocks for web-development are HTML and CSS.  You will be able to build your first projects (and your portfolio) without any JavaScript. 

To cover the basics of HTML/CSS we recommend following [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-front-end-development-projects) as far as the __Basic Front End Projects__.  In this series of exercises and projects you will learn some HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as well as how to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/hello/) to host your projects.  One of the projects is a portfolio web page that you will be able to move over to GitHub to complete your required project.

When you reach the Basic Projects, be sure to do them well.  They will be the first projects in your portfolio!

FreeCodeCamp has a good series of exercises, but it has very few explanations of how things work.  To support you through FreeCodeCamp, we recommend these resources:
* [Marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io) has a very clean and friendly introduction to using HTML and CSS.  
* [W3 Schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [W3 Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). These are less friendly than Marksheet, but have much more information.  You will be using W3 Schools to look up HTML and CSS details for the rest of your developer lifes.  
* FreeCodeCamp has a [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org), a [chat room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/CodeReview), and a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) where you can find support from people working on the same problems as you.
* [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com).  Very well paced introduction to the web environment and using html/css from the bottom up.

Self-Assessments:
* [HTML Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp)
* [CSS Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp)


And as always, don't forget to ask each other for help on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/elewa-academy/shared_invite/enQtMjk4OTA3OTM1NjIwLTA2ZmQ0NDVhNjQxZWM2NjNhNmMyNmVhZGNhZmJmZTY1OWQ4Nzc0ZTkzZGE3NjdiYTYwYThlNzI3YTg2NGM5MGM)!
