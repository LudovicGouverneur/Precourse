# The Internet

<!-- starter taken from old Odin Project -->

Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it).
  
## Learning Outcomes
*At the end of this lesson you should be able to:*

* Describe what the *internet* is
* Describe what *packets* are and how they are used to transfer data
* Understand the differences between a *webpage*, *web server*, *web browser* and *search engine*
* Briefly explain what a *client* is
* Briefly explain what a *server* is
* Explain what *DNS servers* are
* Explain, in your own words, what happens when you **click search** on google.com to a friend!
