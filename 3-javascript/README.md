# JavaScript


Here you will learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language.  The first steps towards becoming a leet hakr mastering the basic structures of JavaScript, and beginning to build a mental model of the computer executes your code.  Don't underestimate how important it is to master these two skills, and don't forget that neither of these skills are as easy as the sound.  Your end goal is to write applications large and small that provide practical solutions to real-world problems, but this is for later.  You won't be able to do this until you've mastered your toolkit.  No matter how smart you are, or how good you are at what you did before learning to code, be prepared to struggle.  

[This is totally normal](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/).  Being good at programming, or learning it quickly, are not indicators of how intelligent you are.  They are indicators of how close your thinking style is to that of a computer programmer.  

Don't be discouraged!  If you master these fundamentals now and continue to work hard through the rest of this curriculum,  you will come out understanding the principles of software development and how they apply to real-world problem solving.  This is a far more important skill than just learning to program.  It will prepare you to join a development team immediately, and give you the foundations necessary to keep improving after you leave.

So study hard! Dig in now, and keep at it every day.  The more you prepare, the more everyone will benefit.

## Specifications

1. Set aside a chapter in your notes for JavaScript language features:    
  * You'll want to build your own 'vocabulary list' to keep track of the built-in JS language features as you come across them.  One of the most common difficulties in the early stages of programming is just remembering all of the language features available!  
  * Having a complete list of everything you know, written in your own words, will be invaluable as you try to start to solve programming challenges on your own.
2. Familiarize yourself with the [JS Tool Kit](https://github.com/elewa-academy/js-tool-kit), especially: 
  * [PythonTutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)
  * [Parsonizer](https://github.com/elewa-academy/js-tool-kit/blob/master/learning-environments.md#parsonizer)
  * [Flow-chart generator](https://github.com/elewa-academy/js-tool-kit/blob/master/learning-environments.md#bogdan-lyashenko).
3. Work your way through the on-line tutorial of your choice (our recommendations are listed in __Resources__ below):  
  * Study the JavaScript sub-chapters in this precourse; __pre-read, step-through, trace, assert, & chunk__.  Practicing these 5 skills as you work through the on-line tutorials will set you up for long-term success.
4. Stay involved!  Studying a little bit (even 15 minutes) every day and staying active on Slack will make you life a lot easier.

## Resources

Below are some recommended resources for learning JavaScript.  Take a look at each one and see what works best for you.  If you find another one you like better, send it our way and we'll put it up!

[Preface](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md)

FreeCodeCamp (recommended & breakdown):
* FCC is a great place to start coding.  It has good exercises, good learning environment, and strong community.
* [intro & basics](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript)
* es6: [let vs var 1](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/explore-differences-between-the-var-and-let-keywords), [let vs var 2](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/compare-scopes-of-the-var-and-let-keywords), [const](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/declare-a-read-only-variable-with-the-const-keyword)
* [data structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures)

Tutorials with more guidance:
* Khan Academy's [awesome interactive coding environment](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#concept-intro) - Great visual & interactive programming environment with guiding videos and detailed lessons.
* Headfirst JavaScript: [PDF](http://wickedlysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Head_First_JavaScript_Programming_SampleChapter.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming) - very thorough and hand-held introduction to using JS in simple websites. You will learn from this even if nothing else works.

_Aditional JS Resources:_

From the web
