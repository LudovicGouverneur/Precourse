## What is GIT ?

* Git is a command-line application that allows you to travel through time.  Every commit saves a complete image of your directory structure at the time of commiting (actually your staged directory structure, but whatever for now). 
* Git allows you to create alternative universes.  With branches you can save two copies of the same directory that differ by a single file/method/bug/...  This is very practical for testing experimental features, fixing bugs, or sharing work across a group.
* Git allows you to commune with parallel dimensions.  'Pull' and 'push' allows your local git commit tree to synchronize with a git tree located anywhere on the internet.  This is how you will use GitHub and how multiple people are able to collaborate on the same codebase.

Git has more tricks up it's sleeves, but these 3 will be enough for now.
