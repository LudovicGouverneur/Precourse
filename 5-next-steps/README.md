# Next Steps

Wow. You finished the precourse project.  Now it's time to get ready for the real deal.

The next big leap is working locally (on your computer, not just web-based editors).

## Specifications

Install the softwares indicated in [Installations](./installations.md).
 

_GIT:_
1. Complete these exercises from [learngitbranching.js.org](http://learngitbranching.js.org/):
  * _Main:_  Introduction Sequence & Ramping Up
  * _Remote:_ Push & Pull -- Git Remotes!
2. Watch and take notes on [Git for Ages 4 and up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4&list=TLj1nt5nzukA8).  It's a bit long but very approachable and so worth the effort.

_Terminal:_
* (If you are on a Windows machine, either install Linux or Cygwin)
* Choose one of these to learn the basics: [LearnEnough](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#sec-man_pages), [Rithmschool](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal), 


_Working Locally:_
* Take notes on your computer:
  * Practice working in the full dev environment by taking notes in Visual Studio, committing with terminal, and using a remote GitHub repo to save your notes (be sure to include this on your portfolio!).  There is one main advantage to learning remote repos with text files instead of code: If something doesn't work you know it's a problem with Git, not your code.
* Developing HTML, CSS & JS Locally:
  * Try moving one of your projects from Glitch to your computer.  You'll use Visual Studio to edit and save your code, and Chrome to open the HTML file and see what you site looks like live.
* As a challenge, try writing and editing your notes from command line using [Nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/). The work-flow is pretty smooth and you'll be forcing yourself to practice using the command line on a daily basis.  (Nano comes pre-installed on Linux & Macs).
