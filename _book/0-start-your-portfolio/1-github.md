# GitHub

Kind of like FaceBook, Linkedin, the library, and a playground for developers.  

You can develop & collaborate directly on GitHub when you're first learning.  When you're more advanced you'll be able to collaborate in any programming language using GitHub directly from your Terminal.  This is when you know you've made it into the big leagues.

For this first project you'll be building a basic portfolio directly from GitHub's website using Markdown, a very simple language for creating websites. You'll be starting very simple so you can get up and running asap.  The goal here is to have a single place to easily host and organize your projects.  You'll get a chance to make cooler portfolios in some of the later projects.
