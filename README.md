## Hello Elewa Students!

It's very important that you build a strong foundation in JavaScript before moving on past the Precourse. Starting unprepared will not only slow down your learning, but will impact your study partners as well.  The pressure is on!

But it's not that bad to get ready, slow and steady wins the race!  Start today and code every day, even just a bit. [Here's a great article](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) about why and how to write code every day.  It's written by John Resig himself, the inventor of jQuery.  This [website](https://codehalf.com) is also a great tool for keeping yourself on track.  

While you're planning your study schedule, try to keep this simple rule in mind: 
> ### 80% JavaScript. 20% everything else.

It is important that you have a portfolio to work with, but don't spend too much time on it yet.  The basic portfolio you'll complete in FreeCodeCamp is enough - it's more important that you have solid JS fundamentals.  And don't worry about having a stylish portfolio just yet, one of our class projects will be rebuilding it with React components.


Take some time to meet the community [on the Elewa Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/elewa-academy/shared_invite/enQtMjk4OTA3OTM1NjIwLTA2ZmQ0NDVhNjQxZWM2NjNhNmMyNmVhZGNhZmJmZTY1OWQ4Nzc0ZTkzZGE3NjdiYTYwYThlNzI3YTg2NGM5MGM).  Help each other with the projects, keep each other motivated, your classmates will be your greatest asset while in our class!
