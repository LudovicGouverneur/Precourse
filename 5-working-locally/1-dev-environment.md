## Dev Environment

Congratulations on finishing the Basic Front End Projects in FreeCodeCamp!  The next thing you need to learn before you can start on your portfolio is how to work with HTML and CSS using true developer tools.  Codepen is great for prototyping and learning, but it's not how you will work for full projects.  Take some time now to familiarize yourself with editing code in Visual Studio Code, and running it in Chrome.


Here are some resources you might find helpful for learning to use Visual Studio Code:
* [VSC video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmbvejtiyNo)

Chrome: 
* [Opening HTML in Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyFKT_uUkik)
* [Intro to Chrome dev-tools](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/part1/)

Terminal:
* [Rithmschool](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal)

Feel free to email us your favorite resources!

Now that you know to run HTML/CSS in the browser, you're one step away from building your portfolio.  Move on to the Git & GitHub.
