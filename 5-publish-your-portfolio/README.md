## Publish Your Portfolio

The portfolio is the modern diploma.  During your time with us you will be continually building and perfecting your portfolio. By the end of your time with us your GitHub account will be a fully navigable portfolio site where employers and collaborators can come to see what you're capable of. 

To set out on the right foot, we expect each of you to come in with the beginnings of your portfolio hosted on GitHub. While building your portfolio you will also be exposed to the basic skills that you will need to succeed in the first weeks: HTML/CSS, Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Git, and Chrome.  

Your portfolio doesn't need to be anything fancy, it can be as simple as this [demo Elewa-Student portfolio](https://elewa-student.github.io).  What's important is that you build an understanding of Web-Development basics.  

Your portfolios are also going to be your first introductions to each other. Keep an eye on this [precoure's Wiki](git@github.com:elewa-academy/April-2018.git) to see what your classmates are up to!


Below are some resources and recommended steps for building your portfolio:

1. [Learn some frontend basics](https://github.com/jankeLearning/apco-precourse/blob/master/required-project-resources/0-front-end-basics.md)
