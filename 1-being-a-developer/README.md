## Being a Developer

Before you dive into the hard stuff, it's worth taking a moment to get your head in the right place.  Some of the resources below will help you set expectations for how much you'll need to work and what kind of progress you can expect to make in your time with Elewa.  Some of these resources are about what developers actually do in their work.  The rest of the resources will give you an overview of the technologies you will be learning.


Absolute must-reads:  
   * [Be reasonable with yourself](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) - Programming takes work, then more work, followed by a lot of practice.  
   * Be bad at something, it's [good for you](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about). 
   * Study [smarter](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g?t=297), not harder!   
   * [Tips to the beginner developer](https://www.codementor.io/learn-programming/tips-on-becoming-a-software-engineer).
   * Watch Traversy Media's [2018 Web Development overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zftx68K-1D4) for a base understanding of the current webdev ecosystem.
  
Other good reads:  
   * [Killer Article](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer) - long, but worth every word.  
   * [Top 8 Developer Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwQ7psiU23I&index=1&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeGY3RMjGo4CgMPN42_U9Glu) - Video series by Mr. Funfunfuncion.  He'll become your good friend. 
   * Software development [isn't about the code](http://elewa.education/2018/01/20/solution-design/).
   * Marksheet.io's [introduction to the internet](https://marksheet.io/introduction.html).
   * Freecodecamp's article on [comparing yourself to others](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-better-way-to-compare-yourself-43cf37616570).  
   * Is programming [like learning a language](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/)?

Highly recommended purchase: 
   * This last resource is a physical book (I know, I'm sorry).  Of all the books, articles, and video's I've seen, this one is probably the best single resource for learning what being a developer is actually about.  It's worth the $20 [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073).

Happy readings!  And please do email us with any great links we might have missed, your classmates will appreciate it.
