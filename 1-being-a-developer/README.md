Absolute must-reads:  
   * [Be reasonable with yourself](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) - Programming takes work, then more work, followed by a lot of practice.  
   * Be bad at something, it's [good for you](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about). 
   * Study [smarter](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g?t=297), not harder!   
   * [Tips to the beginner developer](https://www.codementor.io/learn-programming/tips-on-becoming-a-software-engineer).
   * [What do programmers do?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4a7_HH9Wbg)
  
Other good reads:  
   * [Killer Article](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer) - long, but worth every word.  
   * [Top 8 Developer Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwQ7psiU23I&index=1&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeGY3RMjGo4CgMPN42_U9Glu) - Video series by Mr. Funfunfuncion.  He'll become your good friend. 
   * Software development [isn't about the code](http://elewa.education/2018/01/20/solution-design/).
   * Freecodecamp's article on [comparing yourself to others](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-better-way-to-compare-yourself-43cf37616570).  
   * Is programming [like learning a language](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/)?

Highly recommended purchase: 
   * This last resource is a physical book.  This is one of the best single resource for learning what being a developer is actually like. Rather than talking about how to program, it covers the professional responsibilities of a software developer. [It's on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073).

Happy readings!  And please do email us with any great links we might have missed, your classmates will appreciate it.
